## Preface:
There are errors we simply can't handle but identifying them is crucial, and trying to handle those that we are aware of the best we can is a must.
## Types of errors:
- Compiler errors
- Runtime errors
- Linker errors
- Logical errors
# How to make your code more debuggable 
- Use a consisten style.
- Make concise comments on things that are not expressable through code.
- Avoid nesting as much as you can.
- Keep your functions shorter than a page.
- Use library facilities when possible, avoid starting from scratch on something that is already 
 implemented.
 
## Off:
If we don't have a conception of what is correct, how can we know if our program produces 
reasonable results.
