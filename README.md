# PPP using C++ 2ed Exercises and Answers.

## About
When I was searching how to properly learn C++, I crossed with some smart fellas that point me to this book as one of the best ways to get started, After reading some chapters I thought that documenting the process would be a good idea so here it is.
This repository documents my **personal** solutions of almost every exercise on this book as well as some of the reviews and drills.
