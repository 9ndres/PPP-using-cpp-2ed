## Preface:
There are errors we simply can't handle but identifying them is crucial, and trying to handle those that we are aware of the best we can is a must.
## Types of errors:
- Compiler errors
- Runtime errors
- Linker errors
- Logical errors

## Off:
If we don't have a conception of what is correct, how can we know if our program produces 
a reasonable result.
